# PRODIGY_CS_Task-1
First Internship Task at Prodigitech! üöÄ

I am thrilled to share my first project as a Cyber Security Intern at Prodigitech. 
My initial task was to develop a user-friendly Caesar Cipher application using 
Python and Tkinter. This classic encryption tool allows users to encrypt and
decrypt text by shifting characters based on a specified value. Here's a 
brief overview of the application:

üîê Features:

Encrypt/Decrypt Mode: Users can switch between encryption and decryption modes with a simple radio button selection.
Shift Value Input: A dedicated field to input the shift value for the Caesar Cipher.
Text Input/Output: Separate text areas for entering the original text and displaying the encrypted/decrypted result.
Responsive UI: Designed with Tkinter for a clean and interactive user experience.
For more details and to access the source code, check out my GitHub repository here.

I am excited to continue my journey in cybersecurity at Prodigitech, working on more challenging and innovative projects. Stay tuned for more updates!
